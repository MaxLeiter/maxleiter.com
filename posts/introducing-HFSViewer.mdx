Last year my roommate and I found an old original [iMac G3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3) outside our apartment building. 
It has some interesting early 2000s/late 90s style websites and files on it that I want to preserve (and hope to share here soon!).

But I realized getting files off of it wouldn't be easy.

The machine is running macOS 9.2, which supports USB 1.0.
We're up to USB 4 now, so thats pretty old; none of my modern USB 3 devices were detected by it.
After [some research](https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageApple/comments/1jrmrqv/mac_os_9_hates_usb_sticks/) I found that macOS 9.2 _does_ have USB support, but it can't always negotiate USB 3 speeds or support larger USBs.
So I went and bought [this $5 USB](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W54X2F3) and it worked like a charm.

<Note>
You should try to stick to USBs with less than 2 GBs of storage, otherwise Mac OS 9.2 might not support it. 
</Note>

With that solved and the files copied over, I plugged it into my M4 laptop and... it wasn't recognized there either. No error or mounting occurred due to no driver support.
Eventually I found [hfsutils](https://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/hfs/), a wonderful package (which is convienently accessible from homebrew),
but its a bit antiquated and just a CLI. 

Using Claude Code and the library behind hfsutils "I" made a small Swift UI app for 
browsing and lightly manipulating HFS drives/volumes.

You can find the source code / a binary on [GitHub](https://github.com/MaxLeiter/hfsviewer).
