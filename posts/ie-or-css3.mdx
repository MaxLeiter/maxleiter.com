I was watching Reactathon 2022 this weekend and enjoyed the Syntax fm live session. They did a great audience interaction bit with quizzing them about what a particular piece of CSS did. Inspired, I decided to build a quick quiz.

I decided to take a look into Supabase (coincidentally, they just raised a modest $80M series B). I'm happy I did, because the ease of setting up the database and realtime support was incredible. With a few hours of work I've created a live-updating quiz where you can see others results (after you've voted yourself). You can try the quiz at [/ie-or-css3](/ie-or-css3). I also recommend listening to the Syntax fm segment, timestamped [here](https://youtu.be/Ck-e3hd3pKw?t=22032).
