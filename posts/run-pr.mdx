Today I found myself once again trying to run a pull request that was created in a different GitHub repository. If it was in the same repo, it would be a simple `git checkout`, however because GitHub insisted on the creation of "forks" I now need to go through the extra steps of fetching that specific ref. Here's what I do:

```bash
git fetch https://github.com/${team}/${respository}.git refs/pull/${prId}/head
git checkout FETCH_HEAD
git rebase master # or main
```

Just replace `team`, `repository` and `prId` and you're all set. 

I picked this script up from The Lounge: https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/master/scripts/run-pr.sh. It's a more complete example if you want to start using a script like this. Notice the [`shift`](https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_09_07.html) and bash substitution ([`$@`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3898681)) at the end of it â€”  these allow you to pass in command-line arguments to `yarn start` (or whatever your run script is).
