I've been tinkering with this website and the [Next.js 13 App Router](https://beta.nextjs.org) for a while now,
and it's been a great experience, especially in the last few months. But I've seen some confusion around
how to use the new features and React Server Components, so I wrote up an outline on building this website.

To address the React-sized elephant in the room:
you do not need this fancy setup to build a blog.
HTML and CSS may be a better choice for you, but I'd find little fun in that, and I'm a strong believer in having a website to experiment with.

To set a few expectations, here's what this post **won't** do:

- Act as documentation for Next.js or React
- Be a 100% code-complete tutorial. You'll need to fill in some gaps yourself.
  - You can always reference [this website's source code](https://github.com/maxleiter/maxleiter.com).
  - There are file trees included with links to the source code.

And here's what it **will** do:

- Show you real-world examples involving React Server Components and the App Router.
- Guide you in spinning up your own blog with Next.js 13 and React Server Components with great SEO and performance.
  - I say static first because while you can opt into [dynamic rendering](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/static-and-dynamic-rendering) everything presented here can result in a fully static no-JavaScript site.
- Demonstrate how to enable writing in markdown with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and [next-mdx-remote/rsc](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#react-server-components-rsc--nextjs-app-directory-support)
  - We'll use [Bright](https://github.com/code-hike/bright) for server-side syntax highlighting.
- Act as a launching point for your own experimentation and exploration.

Now that that's out of the way:

### Table of Contents

## Set up the project

First, we'll need to create a new Next.js project. You can launch the setup wizard with `npx create-next-app`:

```bash
npx create-next-app --experimental-app
```

<Note>
  If you want to migrate an existing project, refer to the [Next.js installation
  documentation](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/installation).
</Note>

Hit `y` (or `n`, I'm not your boss) a few times to complete the wizard.

## File structure

The easiest way I've found to thinking about structuring App Router applications is from a top-down approach.
Think of your general path structure, then start with your highest level 'scope' (layout) and work your way down.

In our case, we'll have a [home page](/). Let's also add a [projects page](/projects) and an [about page](/about).
We'll cover the blog in the next section.

In general, a page will look like this:

```tsx
// page.tsx
export default function Page() {
  return <>Your content here</>
}
```

In my case, the three pages we're making all look the same minus their content, so they seem like a strong candidate for sharing a layout.

A Layout will look something like this:

```tsx
// layout.tsx
export default function Layout({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
  return (
    <>
      // Your layout content here
      {children}
      // Or here
    </>
  )
}
```

Knowing all of this, I chose to create four files: `app/layout.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`, `app/projects/page.tsx`, and `app/about/page.tsx`.
The layout will apply to all pages, and each page file will contain it's own content.

I ran into one small issue with this approach: the home page doesn't need a <span style={{ position: 'relative', top: 4 }}><HomeIcon /></span> icon, but the other pages do.
It doesn't make much sense to include that in the home page, but all the other pages should have it,
so we'll keep it out of the root layout and create a [Route Group](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/defining-routes#route-groups) with it's own nested layout layout to only apply to the other pages.

First, lets create our `app/(subpages)/components` directory and create a quick header only for the subpages:

```tsx
// app/(subpages)components/header.tsx
import Link from 'next/link'
import { HomeIcon } from 'react-feather'

export default function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      <Link href="/">
        <HomeIcon />
      </Link>
      // If you want to add a Client Component here like a theme switcher, mark that
      // component with "use client" and leave the majority of the header as an RSC
    </header>
  )
}
```

And use it in our `app/(subpages)/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
// app/(subpages)/layout.tsx
import Header from './components/header'

export default function SubLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      {children}
    </>
  )
}
```

With the header in place, you now have a nested layout for subpages and blog posts.

Let's go ahead and create our files and directories:

## A blog needs posts

### Routing with dynamic segments

For our blog posts like this one, we'll want `/blog/[slug]` to be a page that displays a single blog post, and we want it to have it's own footer to link to other posts.
It sure seems like the footer should live inside the `/blog/[slug]` layout. The `[slug]` in the URL is referred to as a [Dynamic Segment](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/defining-routes#dynamic-segments).

<FileTree>
  <Folder name="blog" open>
    <Folder name="[slug]" open>
      <Folder name="components" open>
        <File
          name="footer.tsx"
          type="component"
          note="<BlogPostFooter />"
          url="https://github.com/MaxLeiter/maxleiter.com/blob/master/app/(subpages)/blog/%5Bslug%5D/post/navigation.tsx"
        />
      </Folder>
      <File
        name="layout.tsx"
        type="layout"
        note="renders <BlogPostFooter />"
        url="https://github.com/MaxLeiter/maxleiter.com/blob/master/app/(subpages)/blog/%5Bslug%5D/layout.tsx"
      />
      <File
        name="page.tsx"
        type="page"
        url="https://github.com/MaxLeiter/maxleiter.com/blob/master/app/(subpages)/blog/%5Bslug%5D/page.tsx"
      />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</FileTree>

But how do we render markdown files in our blog posts?

### Fetching and rendering markdown

The official Next.js documentation has a [great guide](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/guides/mdx#mdx) for using MDX with all your pages.
Sometimes you want to render content from a remote source though, like a <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>.
In my case, for niche specific reasons, I want to keep my markdown separate from the Next.js project, so I'll be using `next-mdx-remote` and it's experimental React Server Components support.

A lot of the code is the same if you want to apply it to your own project, so just follow along with the code snippets.

#### Fetching your posts

You need to fetch your posts from somewhere before you can render them.
There's a lot of ways to do this. Here's a simplified but functional version of mine loading them from the file system:

```tsx
import matter from 'gray-matter'
import path from 'path'
import type { Post } from './types'
import fs from 'fs/promises'
import { cache } from 'react'

// `cache` is a React 18 feature that allows you to cache a function for the lifetime of a request.
// this means getPosts() will only be called once per page build, even though we may call it multiple times
// when rendering the page.
export const getPosts = cache(async () => {
  const posts = await fs.readdir('./posts/')

  return Promise.all(
    posts
      .filter((file) => path.extname(file) === '.mdx')
      .map(async (file) => {
        const filePath = `./posts/${file}`
        const postContent = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8')
        const { data, content } = matter(postContent)

        if (data.published === false) {
          return null
        }

        return { ...data, body: content } as Post
      })
  )
})

export async function getPost(slug: string) {
  const posts = await getPosts()
  return posts.find((post) => post.slug === slug)
}

export default getPosts

// Usage:
const posts = await getPosts()
const post = await getPost('my-post')
```

Because `getPosts` is cached, you can call `getPost` multiple times in your layout tree without worrying about a network waterfall.

#### Rendering your posts

Now that we have our posts, we can render them.

First, we need to setup MDX with any remark and rehype plugins. All the plugins are optional, but I've included the ones I use.

```tsx
// app/(subpages)/blog/[slug]/components/post-body.tsx
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc'

import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
import rehypeSlug from 'rehype-slug'
import rehypeAutolinkHeadings from 'rehype-autolink-headings'
import remarkA11yEmoji from '@fec/remark-a11y-emoji'
import remarkToc from 'remark-toc'
import { mdxComponents } from './markdown-components'

export function PostBody({ children }: { children: string }) {
  return (
    <MDXRemote
      source={children}
      options={{
        mdxOptions: {
          remarkPlugins: [
            // Adds support for GitHub Flavored Markdown
            remarkGfm,
            // Makes emojis more accessible
            remarkA11yEmoji,
            // generates a table of contents based on headings
            remarkToc,
          ],
          // These work together to add IDs and linkify headings
          rehypePlugins: [rehypeSlug, rehypeAutolinkHeadings],
        },
      }}
      components={mdxComponents}
    />
  )
}
```

You may notice the `components={mdxComponents}` prop. This is where we pass in our custom components that we want to use in our markdown files.
For using with Next.js, we probably want to use the official `next/link` and `next/image` components to opt into client side routing and image optimization.
This is also where I've defined the components like the file trees in this post.

```tsx
// app/(subpages)/blog/[slug]/components/markdown-components.tsx
import Link from 'next/link'
import Image from 'next/image'

export const mdxComponents: MDXComponents = {
  a: ({ children, ...props }) => {
    return (
      <Link {...props} href={props.href || ''}>
        {children}
      </Link>
    )
  },
  img: ({ children, props }) => {
    // You need to do some work here to get the width and height of the image.
    // See the details below for my solution.
    return <Image {...props} />
  },
  // any other components you want to use in your markdown
}
```

<details>
<summary>{"How I get the width and height of an image"}</summary>

There's probably a better way to accomplish this (that makes use of the `sizes` prop of next/image),
but I add the intended image width and height to the image URL as query parameters.
This allows me to get the width and height from the URL and pass it to next/image.

```tsx
// app/(subpages)/blog/[slug]/components/mdx-image.tsx
import NextImage from 'next/image'

export function MDXImage({
  src,
  alt,
}: React.DetailedHTMLProps<
  React.ImgHTMLAttributes<HTMLImageElement>,
  HTMLImageElement
> & {
  src: string
  alt: string
}) {
  let widthFromSrc, heightFromSrc
  const url = new URL(src, 'https://maxleiter.com')
  const widthParam = url.searchParams.get('w') || url.searchParams.get('width')
  const heightParam =
    url.searchParams.get('h') || url.searchParams.get('height')
  if (widthParam) {
    widthFromSrc = parseInt(widthParam)
  }
  if (heightParam) {
    heightFromSrc = parseInt(heightParam)
  }

  const imageProps = {
    src,
    alt,
    // tweak these to your liking
    height: heightFromSrc || 450,
    width: widthFromSrc || 550,
  }

  return <NextImage {...imageProps} />
}
```

```tsx
// In a Markdown file
![alt text](/image.png?width=500&height=400)
```

</details>

#### Syntax highlighting with Bright

Bright is a new RSC-first syntax highlighter by [code-hike](https://codehike.org/).
It performs the highlighting on the server, so only the necessary styles and markup are sent to the client.
It also has first-class support for extensions like line numbers, highlighting, or whatever you decide to build.

Install the `bright` package and use it in your MDX components like so:

```tsx
import { Code } from 'bright'
export const mdxComponents: MDXComponents = {
  // the `a` and `img` tags from before should remain
  pre: Code,
}
```

And that's all you need for great syntax highlighting.

Now that we have MDX setup and equipped with our components, we can render a post.

First, let's import the `getPost` function and the `PostBody` component we created earlier.

```tsx
// app/(subpages)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
import getPosts from '@lib/get-posts'
import { PostBody } from '@mdx/post-body'
```

Now we just... render the component.

```tsx
import getPosts, { getPost } from '@lib/get-posts'
import { PostBody } from '@mdx/post-body'
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'

export default async function PostPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: {
    slug: string
  }
}) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug)
  // notFound is a Next.js utility
  if (!post) return notFound()
  // Pass the post contents to MDX
  return <PostBody>{post?.body}</PostBody>
}
```

We can now render a post; that's pretty cool. 

We can optionally choose to build all of our posts at build time, 
by adding `generateStaticParams` to the page:

```tsx
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await getPosts()
  // The params to pre-render the page with.
  // Without this, the page will be rendered at runtime
  return posts.map((post) => ({ params: { slug: post.slug } }))
}
```

<Note>
  If you think it's bad that we call `getPost` _and_ `getPosts()`, remember the
  we wrapped `getPosts` in `cache`. `getPost` just calls
  `getPosts`, so we're not making any unnecessary requests to the filesystem (or
  wherever you're getting your posts from).
</Note>

## SEO

The new Metadata API is fantastic, but it's also a major work in progress. Be sure to check the docs for the latest updates.

### Metadata API

The new [Metadata API](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/metadata) has great documentation, so I won't go into too much detail here.
I define the majority of my layout in the root layout and override it as necessary in the leaf pages.

Here's what my root layout's metadata looks like:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
export const metadata = {
  title: {
    template: '%s | Max Leiter',
    default: 'Max Leiter',
  },
  description: 'Full-stack developer.',
  themeColor: [
    { media: '(prefers-color-scheme: light)', color: '#f5f5f5' },
    { media: '(prefers-color-scheme: dark)', color: '#000' },
  ],
  openGraph: {
    title: 'Max Leiter',
    description: 'Full-stack developer.',
    url: 'https://maxleiter.com',
    siteName: "Max Leiter's site",
    locale: 'en_US',
    type: 'website',
    // To use your own endpoint, refer to https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation
    // Note that an official `app/` solution is coming soon.
    images: [
      {
        url: `https://maxleiter.com/api/og?title=${encodeURIComponent(
          "Max Leiter's site"
        )}`,
        width: 1200,
        height: 630,
        alt: '',
      },
    ],
  },
  twitter: {
    title: 'Max Leiter',
    card: 'summary_large_image',
    creator: '@max_leiter',
  },
  icons: {
    shortcut: 'https://maxleiter.com/favicons/favicon.ico',
  },
  alternates: {
    types: {
      // See the RSS Feed section for more details
      'application/rss+xml': 'https://maxleiter.com/feed.xml',
    },
  },
}
```

And a pages metadata may look like this:

```tsx
// app/(subpages)/about/page.tsx
export const metadata = {
  title: 'About',
  alternates: {
    canonical: 'https://maxleiter.com/about',
  },
}
```

### Sitemap support (`sitemap.js`)

See @leeerob's [announcement tweet](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1639639575843729409) for more details.

```tsx
// app/sitemap.ts
import { getPosts } from './lib/get-posts'

export default async function sitemap() {
  const posts = await getPosts()
  const blogs = posts.map((post) => ({
    url: `https://maxleiter.com/blog/${post.slug}`,
    lastModified: new Date(post.lastModified).toISOString().split('T')[0],
  }))

  const routes = ['', '/about', '/blog', '/projects'].map((route) => ({
    url: `https://maxleiter.com${route}`,
    lastModified: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
  }))

  return [...routes, ...blogs]
}
```

### Generating an RSS Feed

While waiting for of an official solution for RSS feeds, I've created a custom solution that works well for me.
I use the `marked` library to parse the markdown files and then use the `rss` library to generate the RSS feed.
This means the JSX components for MDX are passed through to the RSS feed,
so I just try and ensure the components are legible even when not renderd.

```tsx
// scripts/rss.ts
import fs from 'fs'
import RSS from 'rss'
import path from 'path'
import { marked } from 'marked'
import matter from 'gray-matter'

const posts = fs
  .readdirSync(path.resolve(__dirname, '../posts/'))
  .filter(
    (file) => path.extname(file) === '.md' || path.extname(file) === '.mdx'
  )
  .map((file) => {
    const postContent = fs.readFileSync(`./posts/${file}`, 'utf8')
    const { data, content }: { data: any; content: string } =
      matter(postContent)
    return { ...data, body: content }
  })
  .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.date).getTime() - new Date(a.date).getTime())

const renderer = new marked.Renderer()

renderer.link = (href, _, text) =>
  `<a href="${href}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">${text}</a>`

marked.setOptions({
  gfm: true,
  breaks: true,
  renderer,
})

const renderPost = (md: string) => marked.parse(md)

const main = () => {
  const feed = new RSS({
    title: 'Max Leiter',
    site_url: 'https://maxleiter.com',
    feed_url: 'https://maxleiter.com/feed.xml',
    // image_url: 'https://maxleiter.com/og.png',
    language: 'en',
    description: "Max Leiter's blog",
  })

  posts.forEach((post) => {
    const url = `https://maxleiter.com/blog/${post.slug}`

    feed.item({
      title: post.title,
      description: renderPost(post.body),
      date: new Date(post?.date),
      author: 'Max Leiter',
      url,
      guid: url,
    })
  })

  const rss = feed.xml({ indent: true })
  fs.writeFileSync(path.join(__dirname, '../public/feed.xml'), rss)
}

main()
```

## Deployment

I use Vercel for deployments (I may be bias), but you can use any static site provider you want with a setup
like this because it supports [static export](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/configuring/static-export). 

## Wrapping up

I hope this post was helpful to you. 
As a reminder, you can find the source code for this site [here](https://github.com/maxleiter/maxleiter.com).
Please try to not think negatively of me for anything you find (but feel free to offer praise for anything you like).
