Nintype is hard to explain. Here's a the demo video from back in 2014:

<div style={{ margin: 'auto', maxWidth: '500px', height: '300px' }}>
  <iframe
    style={{
      width: '100%',
      height: '100%',
    }}
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M6DS9Gyf2LM"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
<small style={{ display: 'block', textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <i>"the true touch typing experience"</i>
</small>

Basically, it's a keyboard that lets you seamlessly swipe and type (at the same time) with two thumbs. It might not sound impressive, but it's crazy.
It let's you type _fast_, and it's a joy to use once you get over the somewhat steep learning curve. Seriously, here's my friend texting me about it back in 2015 (sorry for the expletives):

<img

  alt="Text contents: Dude, before yesterday I was trying to swipe whole words on nintype and it wouldn't work super well (like I could go super fast for a second, but make a ton of mistakes because my fingers just wouldn't move correctly in continuous motion) but I recently figured out how to combine tapping and swiping and now it's way fucking faster and better. I'm super fucking pumped, and you're the only nintype person who would understand.
I'm really fucking excited"
  style={{ maxWidth: '350px', margin: 'auto' }}
/>

To this day, I haven't found a keyboard that comes close to Nintype's feature set
and implementation. Thankfully, after breaking sometime before iOS 11, iOS 12 brought
it back to life and you can stil [use it today](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintype/id796959534), at least on iOS.

It's genius lies in a few things:

## Swipe and type

The true secret sauce of Nintype is that you can mix-and-match your swiping and typing at the same time. If you need to double tap a word, like "I'll", you can swipe the first half of the word, and then double tap the "l" key to finish the word.
It's hard to explain, but it's intuitive and unlocks a lot of speed. I can consistently reach above 100 <abbr title="words per minute">WPM</abbr> with ~95-97% accuracy using Nintype.

## Customization

Nintype has options for seemingly everything.
You can add custom shortcuts (like filling your email or credit card number), customize (and disable) the colors/animations, and generally [rice](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/themeing/dictionary#wiki_rice) the heck out of it.
Here's are some screenshots covering (a fraction of) the menu options:

{/* flex box to show them side by side on desktop and vertically if needed */}

<div style={{ 
    display: 'flex',
    flexWrap: 'wrap',
    justifyContent: 'space-evenly',
    gap: 'var(--gap)',
    marginTop: 'var(--gap)',
    marginBottom: 'var(--gap)',
}}>

    />

</div>

## Autospace

Autospace was the most difficult feature for me to embrace, but it's important
