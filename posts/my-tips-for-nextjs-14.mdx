I've been working with the Next.js App Router for a while now, and wanted to share some of the patterns and snippets I've found useful and keep referring to.
My goal is for this post to be a living document, but I haven't been great about writing much so we'll see about that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

<Note>
I'm assuming you have some familiarity with the App Router. If you don't, I recommend you check out my older post: [Build a blog with Next.js 13](/blog/build-a-blog-with-nextjs-13).

### Table of Contents

### SWR for state management

Scenario: You have state you want to share between components, but your components share an RSC parent (or *boundary*) between them so the parent component can't contain the `useState` call:

```server-component.tsx
export function MyServerComponent() {
  return <>
      <Sidebar />
      <Body />
      <OtherSidebar />
      <Footer />
    <>
}
```

You can use SWR to manage that state and subscribe to it in your client components:

```sidebar.tsx
"use client";

import useSWR from 'swr';

export function useAppState() {
  // Second param is a fetcher; we have none.
  const { data, mutate } = useSWR("state:app", null, {
    // Providing fallbackData is optional,
    // but provides type inference and an SSR fallback.
    fallbackData: { currentPostIndex: 0 }
  })

  return { 
    appState: data,
    setAppState: mutate
  }
}

export function Sidebar() {
  const { appState, setAppState } = useAppState();

  return <div>Currently on post {appState.currentPostIndex}</div>
}
```

You can also use the global `mutate` function provided by SWR to update the state from anywhere in your app. See the [SWR docs](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/mutation#mutate) for more info and caveats.

Note that this could also be accomplished with React Context, but I prefer SWR.

#### For Modals and Dialogs

I love using this trick for managing modal state. 
You export a `useModal` hook from the modal file and use it to control the modals state. 
Then you can use the same hook to control the modal from anywhere in your app. I generally include the modal / dialog in the highest shared `layout.tsx` that I know it will be used in.

```warning-dialog.tsx
"use client";

import useSWR, { mutate } from 'swr'

export function useWarningDialog(defaultOpen = false) {
  const { data: showWarningDialog, mutate: setShowWarningDialog } = useSWR(
    'showWarningDialog',
    null,
    { fallbackData: defaultOpen }
  )

  return { showWarningDialog, setShowWarningDialog }
}

export function mutateWarningDialog(showWarningDialog: boolean) {
  return mutate('showWarningDialog', showWarningDialog)
}

export function WarningDialog() {
  const { setShowWarningDialog, showWarningDialog } = useWarningDialog()

  return <Dialog open={showWarningDialog} onClose={() => setShowWarningDialog(false)}>
    ...
  </Dialog>
}
```

```layout.tsx

// You can also use next/dynamic to lazy load the dialog,
// but then you will have to wait the first time it's used on the client.
import { WarningDialog } from './warning-dialog'
export default function Layout({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
  return <>
    {children}
    <Suspense>
      <WarningDialog />
    </Suspense>
  </>
}
```

### Server Actions

Server Actions are my favorite feature in Next.js. They can return JSX, promises, or anything else that React can serialize. With great power comes great responsibility.

#### Validation 

A misconception I've seen with Server Actions is people conflating type inference with validation. Just because you have a type during development doesn't mean you can trust it at runtime.
Your consumer might not have TypeScript, or a [cosmic ray](https://blog.mozilla.org/data/2022/04/13/this-week-in-glean-what-flips-your-bit/) might have flipped a bit in the payload.

My coworker [Gaspar](https://twitter.com/gaspargarcia_/) sent me this tiny higher order function to validate server actions with zod and I've been using it ever since:

```make-action.ts
// this ensures that this utility is only imported on the server
import 'server-only';

export function makeAction<T extends z.ZodTypeAny, R>(
  schema: T,
  fn: (params: z.infer<T>) => R,
): (params: z.infer<T>) => R {
  return (params: z.infer<T>) => {
    const parsedParams = schema.safeParse(params);
    if (!parsedParams.success) {
      // Go to the next section to see why this is probably NOT what you want to do.
      throw new Error(...);
    }
    return fn(parsedParams);
  };
}
```

Usage:
```my-action.ts
"use server";
import { makeAction } from './make-action';
import * as z from 'zod';

const myActionSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.number(),
});

async function myAction(params: z.infer<typeof myActionSchema>) {
  // ...
}

export default makeAction(myActionSchema, myAction);
```

#### Error handling

One common mistake with server actions is expecting Errors to be thrown and caught in the client. If that were the case,
server-only information could be leaked to the client. Instead, you need to return an error object from your server action and handle it in the client.

```action-errors.ts 
export enum MyError {
  InvalidName = 1,
  InvalidAge = 2,
}

export type MyErrorObject = {
  code: MyError;
  message: string;
};

export function makeError(code: MyError): MyErrorObject {
  return { code };
}
```

```my-action.ts
"use server";

async function myAction(params: z.infer<typeof myActionSchema>) {
  const data = await fetch(...)

  if (!data) {
    return makeError(MyError.InvalidName);
  }
}
```

Then on the client, I recommend having a `handleActionError` function or similar to use around your app:

```handle-action-error.ts
export function handleActionError(error: MyErrorObject) {
  switch (error.code) {
    case MyError.InvalidName:
      return toast.error('Name is invalid');
    case MyError.InvalidAge:
      return toast.error('Age is invalid');
    default:
      return toast.error('An error occurred');
  }
}
```

And then use it in your components:

```ts
const onClickHandler = async () => {
  try {
   const result = await myAction({ name: 'John', age: 30 });
   if (result && "error" in result) {
     return handleActionError(result);
   }

    // ...
  } catch (e) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Abstracting the above is left as an exercise to the reader (I haven't found a way I'm very happy with yet).

### Gotcha: Stable references with React.cache

The `cache()` function from React allows you to cache a function during a render.
This is useful if you want multiple RSCs to call the same function without a separate request every time.
However, there's a pretty easy gotcha: React.cache uses reference equality to determine if the function should be re-invoked or not. 
This means that 

```tsx
import 'server-only'
import { cache } from 'react'

function _getResultWithData(resultId: string, fields: string[]) {
  return kv.get(resultId, fields);
}

export const getResultWithData = cache(_getResultWithData);

await getResultWithData('123', ['name', 'age']);
await getResultWithData('123', ['name', 'age']);
```

This will make two requests, because `[name, age] !== [name, age]`.

### You don't need `router.refresh`

`router.refresh` forces a re-render (and re-fetch/validation) of the current page. It's too convienent and easy to reach for.

If your state is changing due to a Server Action, use [`revalidatePath`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidatePath) or [`revalidateTag`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag) to revalidate the page
instead of `router.refresh()`. The new page payload will be included in the server action response, saving you 
a round trip to the server (this also works with `redirect()`). If you aren't using Server Actions for mutations, consider it.
