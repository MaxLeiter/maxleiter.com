I recently came across a great video on LinkedIn, where a 10 year old built a math game in five minutes.

  My 10 year old, Miles, goes from idea to app in 5 minutes, using [Vercel
  v0](https://v0.dev). This is getting interesting.

  Obviously, the above preview was{' '}
  <a href="https://v0.dev/chat/linkedin-dark-mode-wKH3oXBRKKj">made by v0</a>.

That's awesome. It's the reason I love to work on v0. And it speaks to something that I haven't seen enough discussion of: you can use LLMs to spin up bespoke applications in minutes.

If you've used tools like [v0](https://v0.dev), [Claude Artifacts](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9487310-what-are-artifacts-and-how-do-i-use-them), or [ChatGPT's Canvas](https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/), you know what I'm talking about.
You may also may not have been too impressed. At risk of sounding cliche, I say to that: these tools are the worst they'll ever be.
Personally, I think the AI is already good enough, and software developers just haven't mastered using it because
there's always something new to be distracted by. But that's for another post.

Today, most of these tools lack obvious "agentic" behavior. For speed and cost reasons, you get a single "one-shot" response back.
It's naive to think that will remain with the rapid reduction in cost and increased ability of language models. a16z found that,
year over year, there is a 10x decrease in model cost for the same performance:

We're approaching a future where websites, games, and general software can be spun up by a team of AI engineers.
It can be targeted at the user. There are two usecases I'm particularly excited about:

  <li>Education</li>
  <li>User Agents</li>
</ol>

(1) is a basic version of (2). If (2) is accomplished, then (1) is easy. Let me explain.

## Education
