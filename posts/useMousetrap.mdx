I've been messing around with a React implementation of The Lounge lately (for no real reason except that I can) and wanted a functional way to use [Mousetrap](https://craig.is/killing/mice), which TL already uses.  The below hook let me replace the Vue use of Mousetrap (which was pretty much vanilla JS) in a React-like fashion. For bonus typing, add `@types/mousetrap` to your project.

Usage is pretty simple:
```ts
useMousetrap("escape", (evt, combo) => {
	evt.preventDefault
}, "keypress")
```

```ts
import mousetrap from "mousetrap"
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react"

const useMousetrap = (
	handlerKey: string | string[],
	handlerCallback: (evt: KeyboardEvent, combo: string) => void,
	evtType?: "keypress" | "keydown" | "keyup",
) => {
	let actionRef = useRef(handlerCallback)

	useEffect(() => {
		mousetrap.bind(
			handlerKey,
			(evt: KeyboardEvent, combo: string) => {
				typeof actionRef.current === "function" && actionRef.current(evt, combo)
			},
			evtType,
		)
		return () => {
			mousetrap.unbind(handlerKey)
		}
	}, [evtType, handlerKey])
}

export default useMousetrap
```
