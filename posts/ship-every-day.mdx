**Edit**: A better title would've been "_commit_ every day _that you work_". I don't mean you should work on weekends or not take time off, and
whatever you work on doesn't need to "ship to prod". 

<hr />

I don't feel particularly qualified to give advice (I blame imposter syndrome),
but I do have one tip to share that I think has been useful for me.
It applies both to professional software dev and personal projects.

You probably guessed it from the title: **ship something every day**.

It doesn't need to be a major feature or even a bug fix. It just needs to be something you can point to.

Why? A few reasons:

- The dopamine rush of your code being shipped
- Your team sees you're working
  - There's more to this than just performance reviews; with remote work, it's easy for you and co-workers to feel isolated.
- It encourages incremental work. Your future self and co-workers will thank you
- Your git commit streak looks good
  - Yes, in an ideal world this doesn't matter. But I'm sure people like recruiters look at GitHub profiles, and an empty page isn't a great look. This is a benefit of the habit, not necessarily a reason to start it.
- The satisfaction and mental benefits of getting something done.

<Note>
  People mentioned it seems like I'm advocating for you to push _code_ every day. My point is that you should contribute _something_: docs, triage, whatever. For me, it's usually code.
