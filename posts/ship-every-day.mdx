I don't feel particularly qualified to give advice (I blame imposter syndrome),
but I do have one tip to share that I think has been particularly useful for me.
It applies both to professional software dev and personal projects.

You probably guessed it from the title: **ship something every day**.

It doesn't need to be a major feature or even a bug fix. It just needs to be something you can
point to. 

Why? A few reasons:

- The dopamine rush of your code being shipped
- Your team (and manager) sees you're working
- Your git commit streak looks good
  - Yes, people say this doesn't matter. But I'm sure people like recruiters look at GitHub profiles, and an empty page isn't a great look.
- The satisfaction (and mental benefits) of getting something done
