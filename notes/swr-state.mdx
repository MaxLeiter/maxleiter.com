[SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) is a great library for data fetching in React. It looks like this:

```jsx
import useSWR from 'swr'

export function MyComponent() {
  const { data, error } =
    useSWR <
    string >
    ('/api/data',
    fetcher,
    {
      refreshInterval: 1000,
      fallbackData: { name: 'swr' },
    })
}
```

But to me the best part of it is not the data fetching but for it's caching and revalidation features. It's a great tool for state management.

Here's how I manage modals and dialogs:

```tsx
import useSWR, { mutate } from 'swr'

export function useModal() {
  const { data: isVisible, mutate: setVisible } = useSWR<boolean>(
    'state:modal',
    {
      fallbackData: false,
    },
  )

  return {
    isVisible,
    setVisible,
  }
}

// For when you can't use hooks
export const mutateModal = (isVisible) => {
  mutate('state:modal', isVisible)
}
```

Any hook call with that same `state:modal` key will receive the same data and re-render when it changes.
